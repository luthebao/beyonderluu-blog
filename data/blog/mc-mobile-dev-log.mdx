summary: I've started Magic Campus Mobile project. This project is a cross-device game (Mac/Web/Mobile) based on Magic Campus of Lezi

# Disclaimer

Magic Campus Mobile is based on the original game with the same name in china ([Magic Campus](https://mc.lezi.com/)). Maybe in the future, I'll change the name. 

This is the personal project that I made for fun. I'm not own any resources of the game. All the resources are original, and I get it from the original game website.

Due to

>
> Godot 4.2's HTML5 exports currently cannot run on macOS and iOS due to upstream bugs with SharedArrayBuffer and WebGL 2.0. We recommend using macOS and iOS native export functionality instead, as it will also result in better performance.

And I've already upgrade to Godot 4.3 dev 6. And it works!!
