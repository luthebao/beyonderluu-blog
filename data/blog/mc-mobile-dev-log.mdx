# Disclaimer

Magic Campus Mobile is based on the original game with the same name in china ([Magic Campus](https://mc.lezi.com/)). 

This personal project was created for recreational purposes. I do not own any resources related to the game. All the resources are original and obtained from the original game’s website.

Due to

>
> Godot 4.2's HTML5 exports currently cannot run on macOS and iOS due to upstream bugs with SharedArrayBuffer and WebGL 2.0. We recommend using macOS and iOS native export functionality instead, as it will also result in better performance.
>

Furthermore, I have already upgraded to Godot 4.3 development version 6, and it is functioning as intended.
