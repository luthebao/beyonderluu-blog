# Introduction

Magic Campus Mobile is based on the original game with the same name in china ([Magic Campus](https://mc.lezi.com/)). Maybe in the future, I'll change the name lol. I've started Magic Campus Mobile project from this month. Actually, this project is a cross-device game (Mac/Web/Mobile)

# Game Engine

I'm using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) with Gdscript (based on python). This is a new engine but it's free and easy to learn

# First look
