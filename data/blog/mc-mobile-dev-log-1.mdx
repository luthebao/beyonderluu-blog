summary: I've started Magic Campus Mobile project. This project is a cross-device game (Mac/Web/Mobile) based on Magic Campus of Lezi

# Disclaimer

Magic Campus Mobile is based on the original game with the same name in china ([Magic Campus](https://mc.lezi.com/)). Maybe in the future, I'll change the name. 

This is the personal project that I made for fun. I'm not own any resources of the game. All the resources are original, and I get it from the original game website.

# Dev log

I've done the animations of player with Hunter class and wing.

With 2 maps and simple teleport gate.
